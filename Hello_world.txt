How to Run JavaScript Code
All JavaScript we will be writing in the majority
 of the Foundations course will be run via the browser.
  Later lessons in Foundations and the NodeJS path will show 
  you how to run JavaScript outside of the browser environment.
   Outside of these lessons, for now you should always default 
   to running your JavaScript in the browser unless otherwise 
   specified, otherwise you may run into unexpected errors.
